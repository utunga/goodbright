    <h3>The great outdoors: algorithmic theater</h3>

    <p>I created the text for Annie Dorsen's 2017 theater piece <b>The Great Outdoors</b> (in collaboration with <a href="https://schwittlick.net">Marcel Schwittlick</a>). </p>
    <p>This work involved building a system to harvest text from recent comments on the internet, measure the textual entropy of that text, and select it out in various ways to fit the aesthetics of the piece. Developing the algorithm collaboratively with Annie Dorsen was a truly fascinating and wonderful experience. Working at this level in theater was another awesome treat for me. I wrote the project up as a talk for a machine learning meetup, the slides of which are below. </p>

    <p>Over some years I have collaborated with <a href="http://notendo.com" target="_blank" >Jeff Donaldson</a>, one of the early protagonists of the Glitch-Art movement and creator of the Glitchaus fashion brand on his data-knits project. Amongst other things, I created a tool that he can use to take any binary and prepare it for physical projection into woven or knit textile form. Jeff used the program to prepare work for his <a href="http://www.btd-weimar.de/btd/shop/wear-en/glitchaus-dada-data-knit-ed-2/?lang=en">Bauhaus</a> collection as well as other pieces.</p>

    <p>A silly little experiment from March 2023, using GPT to create poetry. Back when we were more excited about such things. GPT choose the content, wrote the poem. I did curate a careful prompt to bound the piece.</p>

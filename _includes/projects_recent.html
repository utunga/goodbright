      <h3>Cashless Society</h3>
      <p class="role">Co-founder / Source</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Distributed crypto meets mutual credit</li>
        <li>Business Design, Pitching, UX</li> 
        <li>Eth / Solidity, Scuttlebutt, React </li>
      </ul> 
      <p>Cashless is about making money human again - merging crypto primitives with a new way to think about mutual credit. We provide an alternative way to keep track of credit through communities and tools for greater reliability and transparency - allowing communities to scale trust and act as their own bank.</p>

    <h3>Resilience App - Mutual Aid World</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Open source, community engagement</li>
      <li>React, Mobile, Heroku, Firebase</li>
    </ul> 
    <p>Thousands of mutual aid groups sprang into existence in March and April 2020. "Mutual Aid World" built software to support such groups. After co-founding with three others I helped organize hundreds of volunteer developers, designers and contributors of all stripes. As well as active tech support we built cryptographically strong contact tracing, a phone support line, and the "resilience app" - which was a react mobile app for organizing delivery of food boxes. In partnership with local groups we helped deliver thousands of food boxes.</p>

    <h3>Research, development and whitepaper on community resilience</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Bayesian modeling</li>
      <li>Decentralized messaging</li>
      <li>Community resilience</li>
    </ul> 
    <p>Research and development into resilient coordination protocols in distributed, unreliable environments. Simulation of information flows in distributed messaging environments. Bayesian modeling of multi-agent systems in the face of variance in the reliability of actors. Most of this work remains proprietary but the 'realtime fact benchmark' is one of it's public outputs.</p>

      <h4>Technical Leadership</h4>

       <p>
        As technical and team lead I have delivered many successful technology projects from the both vendor and client side. As Chief Technology Officer at CreditSights I built an effective team of  developers and technology professionals. And as a scrum master or technical lead I have been an advocate and practitioner of agile for many years. As a founder of various non profit ventures I have experience with recruiting and motivating small teams on limited budgets. Whether vendor or client my philosophy is to you ensure there is a crystal clear overall vision and well motivated and supported team members, who communicate well and are given space to develop to the best of their abilities. If you get these fundamentals right, project success comes much more easily. My references will attest to my significant successes in this area.

      <h4>Business Leadership</h4>
      <p>
        As an IT executive at CreditSights I ensured all the critical systems that were needed by a fast growing, early stage company - from accounting and sales to business intelligence dashboards, server infrastructure and desktop support across multiple offices. Over many years, even after stepping down from CTO and returning to NZ, I have had a strategic level input to the design and vision for our flagship financial products. The "points of difference" that continue to make CreditSights a leader in its field, point to my success in these areas.

      <p>
        In New Zealand I experienced the lean startup methodology close up. I have good, on the ground experience of building small teams towards success, even in a social enterprise context. The successes in my roles as founder at Tradeify Ltd, Hashmapd Ltd and as project lead for the Autism 360 and GroundFacts non-profit projects attest to this.

      <h4>C# / Microsoft.Net developer </h4>
      <!-- <i class="devicon-csharp-plain"></i></h4> -->
      <p>
       I have stayed 'hands on' as an active programmer throughout my career, and had the opportunity to focus much more on these areas after returning to New Zealand to work remotely. As a senior and experienced developer I understand everything C# pretty well - from the latest .Net Core API stack to knowing the level of support for R within the next version of SQL Server (it needs work). In short I know my reference types from my readonly structs and I can design and build a system where your async threads will patiently await the fulfilment of their promises to allow high performance computation and scalability.
      </p>

      <h4>Data Science, Python, Machine learning</h4>
      <!--  <i class="devicon-python-plain-wordmark"></i></h4> -->
      <p>
        I have had a long standing interest in Machine Learning and data science and an intention to focus my efforts more in this area going forwards. As a co-founder at Hashmapd I helped developed a production deep learning system back in 2014 - now available as <a href="http://github.com/utunga/hashmapd">open source</a>. In 2017 and 2018 I built multiple pure python and python + Spark data processing pipelines for unstructured text as well as for structured financial data. 
      </p>
      <h4>Web</h4>
      <p>
        I started as a web developer and still have CSS and HTML in my programming blood. I have extensive hands on experience with the the JS+Node stack (and associated tools) but I have also delivered multiple custom PHP+Wordpress themes and websites when that is the best solution for the problem. As far as front end frameworks go I am more familiar with Angular but I have also recently worked on a project delivering an API to a React front end. 
      </p>
      
      <h4>Cloud Infrastructure</h4>
      <p>
        I am familiar with and have delivered solutions for both Azure and AWS including systems that scale across multiple machines.

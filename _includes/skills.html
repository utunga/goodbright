      <h4>Technical Leadership</h4>

       <p>
        As technical and team lead I have delivered many successful technology projects from the both vendor and client side. </p>
        <p>As <b>Chief Technology Officer at <a href="https://www.creditsights.com">CreditSights</a></b> I built an effective team of  developers and technology professionals. Moving back to NZ to act as a Technical Architect and sometime Scrum Master I have been an advocate and practitioner of agile for many years. As a <b>founder of <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120424032659/http://chchneeds.org.nz/alldb/_design/chchneeds/index.html">various</a> <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140220231032/http://autism360.org:80/">non profit</a> <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110926111640/http://www.tradeify.org/">ventures</a></b> I have experience with recruiting and motivating small teams on limited budgets. As a <b>contracting programmer</b> for many years before that I honed my skills in programming and technical leadership to a senior level. 
        </p>
        <p>Whatever the situation, whether vendor or client, my philosophy is to ensure there is a crystal clear vision and goal for the project. With clear goals and well supported team members, success generally comes with ease. My references will attest to the successes of this straightforward approach over many years.
      </p>

      <h4>Business Leadership</h4>
      <p>
        As an IT executive at CreditSights I ensured all the critical systems that were needed by a fast growing, early stage company - from accounting and sales to business intelligence dashboards, server infrastructure and desktop support across multiple offices. Over many years, even after stepping down from CTO and returning to NZ, I have had a strategic level input to the design and vision for our flagship financial products. The "points of difference" that continue to make CreditSights a leader in its field, point to my success in these areas.  
      </p>
      <p>
        In New Zealand I experienced the lean startup methodology close up. I have good, on the ground experience of building small teams towards success, even in a social enterprise context. The successes in my roles as founder at Tradeify Ltd, Hashmapd Ltd and as project lead for the Autism 360 and GroundFacts non-profit projects attest to this.

      <h4>Data Science, Python, Machine learning</h4>
      <!--  <i class="devicon-python-plain-wordmark"></i></h4> -->
      <p>
        I have had a long standing interest in Machine Learning and data science and an intention to focus my efforts more in this area going forwards. As a co-founder at Hashmapd I developed a production deep learning based system way back in 2014 (now available as <a href="http://github.com/utunga/hashmapd">open source</a>). In 2017 I built multiple pure python as well as Python + Spark data processing pipelines for unstructured text as well as for structured financial data within my work at CreditSights and as part of my theater work.
      </p>
      <h4>Senior C# / Microsoft.Net developer </h4>
      <!-- <i class="devicon-csharp-plain"></i></h4> -->
      <p>
       I have stayed 'hands on' as an active programmer throughout my career, and had the opportunity to focus much more on these areas after returning to New Zealand to work remotely. As a senior and experienced developer I understand everything C# pretty well - from the latest .Net Core API stack to knowing the level of support for R within the next version of SQL Server (it needs work). In short I know my reference types from my readonly structs and I can design and build a system where your async threads will patiently await the fulfilment of their promises to allow high performance computation and scalability.
      </p>

      <h4>Web</h4>
      <p>
        I started out as a web developer and still have CSS and HTML in my programming blood. More recently, I have extensive hands on experience with the the JS/Node stack (and associated tools) but can work easily across a range of web technologies. For instance, I have created many PHP/Wordpress custom themes and websites when that is the best solution for the customer's problem.</p>
      <p>As far as recent front end frameworks go I am most familiar with Angular but have also recently worked on a project delivering an API to a React front end. 
      </p>
      
      <h4>Cloud Infrastructure / Dev Ops </h4>
      <p>
        I am familiar with and have delivered solutions for both Azure and AWS and am comfortable deploying CI and Docker based systems that scale across multiple machines.

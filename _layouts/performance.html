<!-- EDIT: Actually i had to make a couple small fixes/tweaks. And (eek) I edited the poem for length (you folks have no chill) but the complete thing is below as written originally .. in the code -- MKT 26 March 2023-->
<!-- EDIT: It chose the font I don't wanna change that even though not sure I'd agree-->
